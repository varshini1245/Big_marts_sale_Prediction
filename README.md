# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
The goal is to create a prediction model and determine each product's sales at a certain store. Create a model to examine and forecast outlet production sales for Big Mart.

A perfect project to learn Data Analytics and apply Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XG Boost) to predict the outlet production sales.

# Dataset Details 
The data has 8523 rows of 12 variables.
### Variable - Details
